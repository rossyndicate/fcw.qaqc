\title{Extract sensor maintenance field notes from mWater data}
\usage{
grab_mWater_sensor_notes(mWater_api_data)
}
\arguments{
\item{mWater_api_data}{A dataframe containing field notes from mWater, typically
the output from \code{load_mWater()}.}
}
\value{
A dataframe containing only sensor maintenance records with standardized columns:
\itemize{
\item site: Location identifier
\item DT_round/DT_join: Timestamps for joining with sensor data
\item sonde_employed: Binary indicator of deployment status
\item sensor_swapped_notes: Formatted notes about equipment changes
\item Various maintenance fields (sensors_cleaned, cals_performed, etc.)
}
}
\description{
Processes mWater field data to extract and format records specifically related to
sensor maintenance, calibration, and deployment activities. This function filters
for relevant visit types, formats equipment change information, and standardizes
the data structure to match downstream QAQC processing requirements.

This function focuses on routine sensor operations (cleaning, calibration, deployment)
and explicitly excludes sensor malfunction records, which are handled separately by
\code{grab_mWater_malfunction_notes()}.
}
\examples{
# Load mWater data and extract sensor notes
mWater_data <- load_mWater(creds = yaml::read_yaml("creds/mWaterCreds.yml"))
sensor_notes <- grab_mWater_sensor_notes(mWater_data)
