Creates an OAuth client for authenticating with the HydroVu API service. This
function establishes the connection credentials needed to access water quality
monitoring data from HydroVu-connected sondes and sensors. The authentication
uses the OAuth 2.0 protocol to ensure secure access to the API.

This function is typically called once at the beginning of each data collection
cycle to obtain authorization for subsequent API requests.
