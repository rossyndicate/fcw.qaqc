\description{
Moves raw data files from the working API directory to an archive directory
after they have been processed through the water quality monitoring workflow.
This function performs several steps:
\enumerate{
\item Identifies files in the API directory that aren't already in the archive
\item Copies those files to the archive directory
\item Verifies the copy operation
\item Removes all files from the original API directory
}

This function is typically called at the end of the data processing workflow
to maintain a clean working environment while preserving raw data files.
