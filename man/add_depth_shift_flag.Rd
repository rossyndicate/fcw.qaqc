\title{Flag periods when sonde depth was changed}
\usage{
add_depth_shift_flag(df, level_shift_table, post2024 = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame containing water quality measurements. Must include columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{site}: Standardized site name
\item \code{DT_join}: Character timestamp in a format compatible with joining to field notes
\item \code{flag}: Existing quality flags (will be updated by this function)
\item \code{sonde_moved}: Boolean field indicating if sonde was moved (only required when \code{post2024 = TRUE})
}}

\item{level_shift_table}{A data frame containing field notes with information about
when sondes were physically moved. When \code{post2024 = FALSE}, must include columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{site}: Site name matching the df site column
\item \code{DT_join}: Timestamp of the sonde movement
\item \code{type}: Field identifying records where type = "sonde moved"
}}

\item{post2024}{Logical value indicating whether the data is from before (FALSE) or
after (TRUE) the 2024 field season. Default is TRUE.}
}
\value{
A data frame with the same structure as the input, plus an additional
\code{depth_change} column containing "sonde moved" flags where applicable.
}
\description{
Identifies and flags time periods when sondes were physically
moved or repositioned in their housings. Sonde depth changes can affect multiple
parameters and cause discontinuities in the data that aren't related to actual
environmental changes.

The function handles two different data processing workflows:
\itemize{
\item Pre-2024 data: Uses a separate table that tracks when sondes were moved
\item Post-2024 data: Uses information already integrated into field notes
through the \code{sonde_moved} boolean field
}
}
\examples{
# Flag depth changes in post-2024 data
riverbluffs_do_flagged <- add_depth_shift_flag(
  df = combined_data$`riverbluffs-DO`, 
  level_shift_table = all_field_notes
)

# Flag depth changes in pre-2024 historical data
historical_do_flagged <- add_depth_shift_flag(
  df = historical_data$`riverbluffs-DO`,
  level_shift_table = depth_shift_records,
  post2024 = FALSE
)
