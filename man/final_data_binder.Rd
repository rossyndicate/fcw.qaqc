\title{Combine new and historical water quality data}
\usage{
final_data_binder(new_flagged_data, historical_flagged_data)
}
\arguments{
\item{new_flagged_data}{A list of dataframes containing newly processed and flagged
water quality data. Each list element should be named with a site-parameter combination
(e.g., "riverbluffs-Temperature") and include a \code{historical} column indicating which
records overlap with the historical dataset.}

\item{historical_flagged_data}{A list of dataframes containing previously processed
water quality data. Each list element should be named with a site-parameter combination
matching elements in \code{new_flagged_data}.}
}
\value{
A list of dataframes containing the merged data, with dataframes named by
site-parameter combinations. Records in the 24-hour overlap period will retain flags
from the new data.
}
\description{
Merges newly processed water quality data with the existing historical dataset,
handling the overlap period appropriately. This function ensures continuity in
the long-term dataset while incorporating the latest quality control flags.

The function handles a 24-hour overlap period specifically, where new data may
contain updated flags for historical data based on context that wasn't available
during previous processing runs.
