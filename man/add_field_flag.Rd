\title{Flag data periods affected by field activities}
\usage{
add_field_flag(df)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A dataframe containing water quality data with field notes already
joined. Must include columns:
\itemize{
\item flag: Existing quality flags
\item sonde_employed: Binary indicator of sonde deployment status (1 = not in water)
\item last_site_visit: Timestamp of the most recent site visit
\item DT_round: Rounded timestamp for each data record
}}
}
\value{
A dataframe with the same structure as the input, but with the flag
column updated to include "sonde not employed", "site visit", and/or "sv window"
flags as appropriate.
}
\description{
Identifies and flags time periods in water quality data that are affected by
field activities such as sensor maintenance, calibration, or deployment changes.
This function marks three distinct conditions related to field operations:
\enumerate{
\item "sonde not employed" - Periods when the sensor was physically removed from
the water body (indicated by sonde_employed = 1 in field notes)
\item "site visit" - Exact timestamps when field technicians were actively
working with the equipment on site
\item "sv window" - A buffer period around site visits (15 minutes before and
60 minutes after) when data may be affected by field activities
}

These flags identify periods when readings may not reflect natural environmental
conditions due to human interference. The function requires that field notes
have already been joined to the water quality data.
