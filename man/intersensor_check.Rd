\title{Remove redundant slope violation flags across parameters}
\usage{
intersensor_check(df)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame containing all parameters for a single site. Must include columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{DT_round}: Timestamp for each measurement
\item \code{DT_join}: Character timestamp used for joining
\item \code{parameter}: Measurement type
\item \code{mean}: The calculated mean value of measurements
\item \code{flag}: Existing quality flags containing "slope violation" flags to be checked
}}
}
\value{
A data frame with the same structure as the input, but with the \code{flag}
column updated to remove "slope violation" flags that coincide with temperature
or depth changes, and with all "slope violation" flags removed from temperature
and depth parameters.
}
\description{
Reduces overflagging by identifying and removing "slope violation" flags that likely
represent real environmental changes rather than sensor malfunctions. When rapid changes
occur simultaneously in multiple parameters, especially in temperature or depth, these
changes typically reflect actual hydrologic events rather than sensor problems.

This function processes all parameters from a single site and:
\enumerate{
\item Identifies concurrent slope violations across parameters
\item Removes "slope violation" flags from non-temperature, non-depth parameters when they
coincide with similar flags in temperature or depth
\item Removes all "slope violation" flags from temperature and depth parameters, as these
parameters rarely exhibit false spikes
}
}
\examples{
# Remove redundant slope violation flags at the riverbluffs site
riverbluffs_corrected <- intersensor_check(df = all_flagged_data$riverbluffs)

# Remove redundant slope violation flags at the boxelder site
boxelder_corrected <- intersensor_check(df = all_flagged_data$boxelder)
