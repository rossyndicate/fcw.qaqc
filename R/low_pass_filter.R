#' @description
#' Reduces high-frequency noise in turbidity measurements using a 5-point binomial kernel
#' low-pass filter applied three times in succession. This function specifically addresses
#' the noise characteristics of optical turbidity sensors, which are prone to rapid 
#' fluctuations due to suspended particles, biofouling, and electronic interference.
#' 
#' The filter uses a binomial kernel with weights `[1,4,6,4,1]` normalized by dividing by 16, which provides
#' a Gaussian-like smoothing effect. This kernel gives the greatest influence to the 
#' current measurement, moderate influence to the measurements 15 minutes before and 
#' after, and least influence to the measurements 30 minutes before and after. The 
#' triple application of the filter creates a more aggressive smoothing effect equivalent
#' to a higher-order binomial filter.
#' 
#' This function currently processes only turbidity data, as turbidity sensors are 
#' particularly susceptible to noise from suspended particles and optical interference.
#' For other parameters, the function returns the input dataframe unchanged.
#' 
#' @param df A data frame containing water quality measurements. Must include columns:
#' - `parameter`: The measurement type (function checks for "Turbidity")
#' - `mean`: The calculated mean value of measurements to be smoothed
#' - `DT_round`: Timestamp for temporal alignment (used for rolling window operations)
#'
#' @return A data frame with the same structure as the input, but with an additional
#' `smoothed_mean` column containing the filtered turbidity values. For non-turbidity
#' parameters, returns the original dataframe unchanged.
